# Contributing

We welcome contributions of any size and skill level. As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors and are happy to help with guidance on PRs, technical writing, and turning any feature idea into a reality.

## Why contribute to open source?

[**@FredKSchott:**](https://twitter.com/FredKSchott) As a personal story - I got started in open source by randomly contributing to an npm package named `request`. At the time, the package was the third-most-used package on npm and was receiving millions of downloads a week. It was all maintained by one person and a couple of in-and-out contributors.

Thanks to a combination of free time, hard work and luck I was able to contribute and eventually become a lead maintainer of the project. For a long time I was one of 3 people in the world who could deploy some code (`npm publish request`) that would get immediately picked up by almost every Node.js project on the planet via `npm install`. It was exciting and a bit scary ðŸ˜….

At the same time, I had a day job where I was a junior software developer at a random tech co. I was surrounded by interesting projects, but I mostly did busy work. I had asked my manager if I could go up for a promotion and he said no. At least they paid me!

The Astro community is my personal attempt to share this experience with others who might be looking for the same thing as I was. Everyone is at different stages in their life and career, and my personal experience as "slightly bored junior developer" isn't a one-size-fits-all for why you should get involved in open source. Instead, here are some of my favorite things that I got out of open source development that I think apply to anyone:

- **Job opportunities:** Having the line "maintains code used by millions of developers" on my resume was an incredible way to stand out in every single job search I did for years afterwards.
- **Instant dev cred:** I was accepted to give my first public talk at a conference based solely on my open source work. It was a terrible talk, but whose first talk is good!? :D
- **Leadership/mentorship opportunities:** I went from having zero responsibility at work to being a respected voice/opinion in the `request` GitHub issues and PRs.
- **Learning from smart people:** I got to meet and learn from so many smart people across the open source ecosystem.
- **preventing imposter syndrome:** Sure, I was still just a kid, but having an actual human connection to developers who I looked up to at the time helped dispell the idea that "oh, _I_ could never be like that."
- **Making friends in the larger community:** The creator of request, [@mikeal](https://twitter.com/mikeal), is still a friend to this day.

If any of this sounds interesting, I hope you consider getting involved with Astro. Come say hi in the [**#new-contributors**][discord] channel on Discord anytime. We're always around and value contributions of any shape/size.

# Contributor Manual

## Prerequisite

Youâ€™ll need the following tools set up on your system to contribute to this codebase:

- [Node 14.x or 16.x][install-node]
- [Yarn 1.x][install-yarn] (_Note: we do NOT use Yarn 2!_)
- [Git 2.x][install-git]

## Setting up Astro locally

All work on Astro begins by downloading a copy locally. Start by [**forking**][how-to-fork] this repository (if youâ€™re new to this, [GitHub has a great detailed guide][how-to-fork]). You should end up with an `astro/` code folder on your local machine.

Switch to this folder by opening your **Terminal application** of choice and running:

```
cd /[path to my code folder]/astro
```

Next, youâ€™ll need to install dependencies and set up the project. You can do that by running the following commands from within the `astro/` folder:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

This will download everything you need and build Astro locally for use. Youâ€™re ready to go!

## Development

While working within packages (such as `packages/astro/*`), you may notice you have to run `yarn build` to see your changes. This process can really slow you down if you are trying many changes at once. Try running the following instead:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start a build watcher, which will rebuild files as you work. Use this to speed up your workflow, and see your changes more rapidly.

Of course, you can still build all files within a package, as before. You may need to do so from time to time:

```
yarn build
```

## Running tests

Youâ€™ll need to run existing tests to make sure your work didnâ€™t cause any regressions. To create a fresh build and run all tests, run the following from the project root:

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn test
```

If you find yourself wanting to not run the whole test suite, you can run the following instead:

```
cd packages/astro
yarn test astro-markdown
```

Replace â€œ`astro-markdown`â€œ with any part of a test filename to only run those tests.

## Making a Pull Request

When youâ€™re ready to commit your work and submit it for review, youâ€™ll need to do the following:

1. Create a new **branch**:
   ```
   git checkout -b fix-homepage-bug
   ```
1. **Commit** your changes:
   ```
   git add *
   git commit -m "Fix layout bug on homepage"
   ```
   _Note: be short and specific in your message! This will live forever!_
1. **Push** your changes:
   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin fix-homepage-bug
   ```
1. Add a **changeset** message:

   ```
   yarn changeset
   ```

   Your changeset message will be what appears publicly in release notes. Itâ€™s all right if itâ€™s more verbose than your commit message.

   Also, while Astro is pre-1.0, you probably want to only make **patch** changes, unless youâ€™re releasing a huge, sweeping, breaking change as a **minor** release ([what is semver?][semver]).

1. [Open a new Pull Request][astro-pr] on Astro with your changes.

Be sure to **fill in the template** completely! It helps other people review your work.

If you need to create a pull request to get early feedback, thatâ€™s OK, too.

Creating your first Pull Request can seem like a lot of steps at first, but with time and practice itâ€™ll become comfortable.

## Other useful commands

```shell
# auto-format the entire project
# (optional - a GitHub Action formats every commit after a PR is merged)
yarn format
```

```shell
# lint the project
# (optional - our linter creates helpful warnings, but not errors.)
yarn lint
```

## Running benchmarks

We have benchmarks to keep performance under control. You can run these by running (from the project root):

```shell
yarn workspace astro run benchmark
```

Which will fail if the performance has regressed by **10%** or more.

To update the times cd into the `packages/astro` folder and run the following:

```shell
node test/benchmark/build.bench.js --save
node test/benchmark/dev.bench.js --save
```

Which will update the build and dev benchmarks.

# Releasing Astro

_Note: Only priviledged contributors (L3+) can release new versions of Astro._

The repo is set up with automatic releases, using the changeset GitHub action & bot.

To release a new version of Astro, find the `Version Packages` PR, read it over, and merge it.

## Releasing PR preview snapshots

Our release tool `changeset` has a feature for releasing "snapshot" releases from a PR or custom branch. These are npm package publishes that live temporarily, so that you can give users a way to test a PR before merging. This can be a great way to get early user feedback while still in the PR review process.

To release a snapshot, run the following locally:

```shell
# Note: XXX should be a keyword to identify this release. Ex: `--snapshot routing` & `--tag next--routing`

# 1:
yarn changeset version --snapshot XXX
# 2: (Manual) review the diff, and make sure that you're not releasing more than you need to.
git checkout -- examples/ docs/ www/
# 3:
yarn release --tag next--XXX
```

Full documentation: https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/main/docs/snapshot-releases.md

## Releasing `astro@next` (aka "prerelease mode")

Sometimes, the repo enters "prerelease mode", which means that `main` is no longer releasing to `npm install astro` but is instead releasing to `npm install astro@next`. We do this from time-to-time to test large features before sharing them with the larger Astro audience.

When in prerelease mode, the automatic PR release process is for `next`. That means that releasing to `latest` becomes a manual process. To release latest manually while in prerelease mode:

1. _In the code snippets below, replace `0.X` with your version (ex: `0.18`, `release/0.18`, etc.)._
1. Create a new `release/0.X` branch, if none exists.
1. Point `release/0.X` to the latest commit for the `v0.X` version.
1. `git cherry-pick` commits from `main`, as needed.
1. Make sure that all changesets for the new release are included. You can create some manually (via `yarn changeset`) if needed.
1. Run `yarn changeset version` to create your new release.
1. Run `yarn release` to publish your new release.
1. Run `git push && git push --tags` to push your new release to GitHub.
1. Run `git push release/0.X:latest` to push your release branch to `latest`. This will trigger an update to the docs site, the www site, etc.
1. Go to https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/releases/new and create a new release. Copy the new changelog entry from https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro/blob/latest/packages/astro/CHANGELOG.md.
1. Post in Discord #announcements channel, if needed!

### Entering prerelease mode

If you have gotten permission from the core contributors, you can enter into prerelease mode by following the following steps:

- Run: `yarn changeset pre enter next` in the project root
- Create a new PR from the changes created by this command
- Review, approve, and more the PR to enter prerelease mode.
- If successful, The "Version Packages" PR (if one exists) will now say "Version Packages (next)".

### Exiting prerelease mode

Exiting prerelease mode should happen once an experimental release is ready to go from `npm install astro@next` to `npm install astro`. Only a core contributor run these steps. These steps should be run before

- Run: `yarn changeset pre enter next` in the project root
- Create a new PR from the changes created by this command.
- Review, approve, and more the PR to enter prerelease mode.
- If successful, The "Version Packages (next)" PR (if one exists) will now say "Version Packages".

# Translations

Help us translate [docs.astro.build][docs] into as many languages as possible! This can be a great way to get involved with open source development without having to code.

Our translation process is loosly based off of [MDN.](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/12/an-update-on-mdn-web-docs-localization-strategy/)

### Important: Beta Status

Astro is changing quickly, and so are the docs. We cannot translate too many pages until Astro is closer to a v1.0.0 release candidate. **To start, do not translate more than the "getting started" page.** Once we are closer to a v1.0.0 release candidate, we will begin translating all pages.

### Tier 1: Priority Languages

**Tier 1** languages are considered a top priority for Astro documentation. The docs site should be fully translated into these languages, and reasonably kept up-to-date:

- Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
- Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- French (fr)
- Japanese (ja)

We are always looking for people to help us with these translations. If you are interested in getting involved, please [reach out to us on Discord][discord] in the `i18n` channel.

### Tier 2 Languages

All other languages are considered **Tier 2**. Tier 2 language translations are driven by the community, with support from core maintainers. If you want to see the Astro docs site translated into a new language, then we need your help to kick off the project!

If you are interested in getting involved, please [reach out to us on Discord][discord] in the `i18n` channel.
