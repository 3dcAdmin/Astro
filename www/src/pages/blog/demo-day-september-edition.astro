        **Astro Demo Day** was today! We had **4** amazing talks, including one big announcement on the future direction of Astro. If you missed it that's really unfortunate, but good news!

So you'll never miss another demo day please [subscribe to our channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFjmvZEK-MoefuYXptnX6A), or better yet [join our Discord](https://astro.build/chat) and get involved.

        ## astro@next

        In their talk on the changes coming to the new compiler Drew and Nate unveiled a few new features not available in Astro today. They *also* unveiled a surprising new runtime for Astro. You'll have to watch the talk to learn what those are...

        What I can say, however, is that we are getting close to a PR and preview release of the v2 compiler. In fact it might have already happened! By tomorrow we fully expect you to be able to install and try out the new version of Astro through an `astro@next` tag published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro).

        If you're not already, follow [@astrodotbuild](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) on Twitter and await that announcement.

        These demo days keep getting better; I can't wait to see what we have in October!
