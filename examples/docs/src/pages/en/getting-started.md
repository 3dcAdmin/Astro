This template already provides your pages with a side bar navigation (on the left) for your pages, and a content navigation (on the right) for your sections.

## Page navigation

The page navigation, through the side bar on the left, needs to be manually updated. Open the `config.ts` file and you will find the following structure:

```ts
export const SIDEBAR = {
  en: [
    { text: 'Introduction', header: true },
    { text: 'Getting Started', link: 'en/getting-started' },
    { text: 'Example', link: 'en/example' },
  ],
  es: [
    { text: 'IntroducciÃ³n', header: true },
    { text: 'Empezando', link: 'es/getting-started' },
    { text: 'Ejemplo', link: 'es/example' },
  ],
  fr: [
    { text: 'Introduction', header: true },
    { text: 'Commencer', link: 'fr/getting-started' },
    { text: 'Exemple', link: 'fr/example' },
  ],
};
```

The sidebar supports many languages, and each language has items to display, and pages to link to, allowing for a truly native experience for international users. You can change this file to match the pages you want to display, the object with the `{ header: true, ... }` set to true will act as a section title and cannot contain a link.

The page navigation is generated in the `src/components/LeftSidebar/LeftSidebar.astro`, so if you want to change the depth of elements displayed, styles, etc, that's the place to go.

## Section navigation

The section navigation, through the side bar on the right, is automatically generated by the `src/components/RightSidebar/RightSidebar.astro` file, it uses the meta-data from markdown files to generate the structure you see.

By default only elements from depth 2 to 5 will be displayed, and at the moment doesn't work for `.astro files`.

## Other Components

### Footer

You can edit your footer here `src/components/Footer/Footer.astro`, at the moment it is composed of a list of avatars. You can generate your own avatar [here](https://getavataaars.com/) and replace the ones from `src/components/Footer/AvatarList.astro`.

### Theme

The `src/components/RightSidebar/ThemeToggleButton.tsx` is only responsible for applying the theme, to change the theme colors see `public/theme.css`

## Internationalization

You will need to setup redirect mechanism, via `vercel`, `netlify`, etc... that redirects users to the correct pages for their language, by default `Astro` doesn't do this for you, so keep this in mind when looking for potential web hosts.
