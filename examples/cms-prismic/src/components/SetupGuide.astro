# Let's Setup Prismic

## 1. Custom Type Setup
First, we have to setup the Prismic custom post type.
Follow the official guide from prismic here.

**Custom Post Type Reference**<br>
Name: **Homepage**<br>
API ID: `homepage`<br>
Type: **Single**

## 2. Add Field To Custom Type
For the sake of simplicity, we will only create one `title` field for the `homepage` post type.	

There are 2 ways to do this:
1. Copy the template from `homepage.json` in the `Prismic Template` folder. and paste it to the custom type JSON editor. [Follow this guide](https://prismic.io/docs/core-concepts/content-modeling-with-json)
2. **OR**, Do it manually using the Prismic drag-and-drop interface.

## 3. Fill The Field
Super obvious step.
We need to fill the field with something so it will show something when we connect Prismic with Astro.

## 4. Get Prismic API and Setup
1. Get your Prismic API ðŸ‘‡

2. Copy and store the API key in the `.env` file following the sample of `.env.example`.
