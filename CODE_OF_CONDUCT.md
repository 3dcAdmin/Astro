# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and [inclusive language](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on the bigger picture: what is best for the community?
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Guide to Maintaining these Standards

When interacting in our community, strive to maintain a friendly, empathetic tone. This includes, but is not limited to, interactions on Discord, GitHub, and Twitter.

"Tone" refers to word, punctuation, and conversational choices that determine how your message _feels_ to others.

Compare these two responses:

_Question:_ Hey, I'm beginning with Astro. I tried to use `document` in my Astro page, but it says that the object doesn't exist. How can I manipulate the DOM?

| Answer 1 | Answer 2 |
| -- | -- |
| You can't manipulate the DOM from an Astro file. Astro is a static site builder. | Hey, welcome to the community! <br/> Astro pages and components run on the server. Because of that, you won't have access to everything you're used to when writing JavaScript for the web. You're on the right track, though - you can access `document` from a `<script>` tag in your Astro file. <br/> Check out the docs here, and let me know if you need any more help! https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#client-side-scripts |

Answer 2 took more effort, but it made a significant difference. This response:

- welcomed the new member into the community
- made them feel validated for asking the question ("You're on the right track")
- provided an explanation that fit the person who asked the question: _Answer 2_ sought to explain things to a self-described beginner, who might not understand the implications of "static site builder"
- made it clear that the community is willing to help and that asking is not a burden ("let me know if you need any more help!")

Our community prides itself on being _positive_, _helpful_, and _inclusive_. If you have these goals in mind when interacting in the community, you're on the right track!

- To stay positive:

  - Make it clear that you appreciate the other person's contributions.
  - Aim to learn: even complaints can be valuable feedback.
  - Look for alternate interpretations of your message before sending, and consider clarifying your intent if you're unsure how your words might come across (using exclamation points and emojis to convey friendliness is generally üëç !)
  - During conflict: maintain respect, avoid aggression, and avoid involving personal personal pronouns ("you").
  - Set boundaries. Feel free to step away from a conversation when you feel frustrated.

- To stay helpful:

  - Seek to understand the the other person's desired outcomes. Are they looking for assistance? Just wanting to vent?
  - When explaining something, first establish the knowledge level of the person you're responding to. Match your explanation to that level.
  - Ask clarifying questions. If you're not sure what the person meant, ask them if your understanding is correct. If you're not sure what they already know, ask them if they're aware of a concept.

- To stay inclusive:

  - Refer to someone by their expressed name. Don't use your own nicknames for someone (unless you're friends with established trust).
  - Refer to someone by their expressed pronouns. If this wasn't expressed, use [`they/them`](http://pronoun.is/they/them), which in English can be used to refer to people of any gender.
  - If you sense hesitancy in someone's participation, make it clear that you're happy they're participating.
  - Advocate for someone if you see that they're being dismissed.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md#Moderation) for instructions on reporting a Code of Conduct violation and a full description of the review process.
