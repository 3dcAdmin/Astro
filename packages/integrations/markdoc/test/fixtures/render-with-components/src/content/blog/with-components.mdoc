## Post with components

This uses a custom marquee component with a shortcode:

{% marquee-element direction="right" %}
I'm a marquee too!
{% /marquee-element %}

{% counter /%}

{% partial file="_example.mdoc" /%}

And a code component for code blocks:

```js
const isRenderedWithShiki = true;
```
