Adds a new optional `astro:assets` image attribute `inferSize` for use with remote images.

Remote images can now have their dimensions inferred just like local images. Setting `inferSize` to `true` allows you to use `getImage()` and the `<Image />` and `<Picture />` components without setting the `width` and `height` properties.

```astro
---
import { Image, Picture, getImage } from 'astro:assets';
const myPic = await getImage({ src: "https://example.com/example.png", inferSize: true })
---
<Image src="https://example.com/example.png" inferSize alt="" />
<Picture src="https://example.com/example.png" inferSize alt="" />
```
