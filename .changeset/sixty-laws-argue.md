Prefetching is now supported in core

You can enable prefetching for your site with the `prefetch: true` config. It is enabled by default when using [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) and can also be used to configure the `prefetch` behaviour used by View Transitions.

Visit the [Prefetch guide](https://docs.astro.build//en/guides/prefetch/) for more information.
