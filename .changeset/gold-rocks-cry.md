Add a new experimental flag (`experimental.assets`) to enable our new core Assets story.

This unlocks a few features:
- Image component and JavaScript API to transform and optimize images.
- Support for images stored relatively to your content in Markdown.
- Support for validating assets using Content Collections.
- and more!

See [Assets (Experimental)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/) on our docs site for more information on how to use this feature!
