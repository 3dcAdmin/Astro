Renames Dev Overlay to Dev Toolbar

The previously named Dev Overlay is now known as the Astro Dev Toolbar. Additionally what were called Plugins are now Toolbar Apps. This updates our references to reflect.

As there were a lot of APIs that used these names, the existing APIs are left in place, and aliases for the new Toolbar based names are included as well, which is what will be documented.
