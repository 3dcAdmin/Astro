Introduces a new config option, `isr`, that allows you to deploy your project as an ISR function. [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) caches your on-demand rendered pages in the same way as prerendered pages after first request.

To enable this feature, set `isr` to true in your Vercel adapter configuration in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
    output: "server",
    adapter: vercel({ isr: true })
})
```


## Cache invalidation options

By default, ISR responses are cached for the duration of your deployment. You can further control caching by setting an `expiration` time or prevent caching entirely for certain routes.

### Time-based invalidation

You can change the length of time to cache routes this by configuring an `expiration` value in seconds:

```js
export default defineConfig({
    output: "server",
    adapter: vercel({
        isr: {
            // caches all pages on first request and saves for 1 day
            expiration: 60 * 60 * 24
        }
    })
})
```

### Manual invalidation

To implement Vercel's [Draft mode](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/features#draft-mode), or [On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/features#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-isr), you can create a bypass token and provide it to the `isr` config along with the paths to exclude from caching: 

```js
export default defineConfig({
    output: "server",
    adapter: vercel({
        isr: {
            // A secret random string that you create.
            bypassToken: "005556d774a8",
            // Paths that will always be served fresh.
            exclude: [ "/api/invalidate" ] 
        }
    })
})
```
