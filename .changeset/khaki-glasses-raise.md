## Integration Hooks to add Middleware

It's now possible in Astro for an integration to add middleware on behalf of the user. Previously when a third party wanted to provide middleware, the user would need to create a `src/middleware.ts` file themselves. Now, adding third-party middleware is as easy as adding a new integration.

For integration authors, there is a new `addMiddleware` function in the `astro:config:setup` hook. This function allows you to specify a middleware module and the order in which it should be applied:

```js
// my-package/middleware.js
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
  const response = await next();

  if(response.headers.get('content-type') === 'text/html') {
    let html = await response.text();
    html = minify(html);
    return new Response(html, {
      status: response.status,
      headers: response.headers
    });
  }

  return response;
});
```

You can now add your integration's middleware and specify that it runs either before or after the application's own defined middleware (defined in `src/middleware.{js,ts}`)

```js
// my-package/integration.js
export function myIntegration() {
  return {
    name: 'my-integration',
    hooks: {
      'astro:config:setup': ({ addMiddleware }) => {
        addMiddleware({
          entrypoint: 'my-package/middleware',
          order: 'pre'
        });
      }
    }
  };
}
```
