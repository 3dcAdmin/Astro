Adds experimental session support

Sessions are used to store user state between requests for server-rendered pages, such as login status, shopping cart contents, or other user-specific data.

```astro
---
export const prerender = false; // Not needed in 'server' mode
const cart = await Astro.session.get('cart');
---

<a href="/checkout">ðŸ›’ {cart?.length ?? 0} items</a>
```

Sessions are available in on-demand rendered/SSR pages, API endpoints, actions and middleware. To enable session support you must configure a storage driver. If you are using the Node.js adapter, you can use the `fs` driver to store session data on the filesystem:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
{
  adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
  experimental: {
    session: {
      // Required: the name of the Unstorage driver
      driver: "fs",
    },
  },
}
```
If you are deploying to a serverless environment there are other drivers that you can use, such as `redis` or `netlifyBlobs` or `cloudflareKV`.

For full details, see [the docs for experimental session support](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/experimental-flags/sessions/).
