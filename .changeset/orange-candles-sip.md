'astro': patch
---

Adds new accessibility audits to the Dev Toolbar's built-in Audits app.

The audits Astro performs are non-exhaustive and only intended to catch a handful of common accessibility issues. Please take care to perform a thorough accessibility audit before releasing your website.

ðŸ§¡ Huge thanks to the [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) team for providing the basis of these accessibility audits!
