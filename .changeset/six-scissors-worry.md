Bumps shikiji and exposes a new `markdown.shikiConfig.transformers` config option. You can use this option to transform the shikiji hast (AST format of the generated HTML) to extend the features of the final HTML. See [shikiji's documentation](https://shikiji.netlify.app/guide/transformers) for more details.
