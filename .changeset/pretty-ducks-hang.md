The Picture component is no longer experimental

The `<Picture />` component, part of `astro:assets`, has exited experimental status and is now recommended for use. There are no code changes to the component, and no upgrade to your project is necessary.

This is only a change in documentation/recommendation. If you were waiting to use the `<Picture />` component until it had exited the experimental stage, wait no more!
