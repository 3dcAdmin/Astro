"@astrojs/vercel": patch
---

Marks the `speedInsights` configuration as deprecated. Vercel has migrated features of the Speed Insights API into a framework-agnostic library with `@vercel/speed-insights`. See [Vercel Speed Insights Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart) for instructions on how to use the library instead.
